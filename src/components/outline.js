                <p>“LEH introduced iPads on a one to one basis as a way to enhance digital learning. Using digital textbooks is an important extension of this initiative. Our students are really enjoying using Classoos and we look forward to them having the opportunity of accessing many new titles not yet available on other digital platforms.”</p>

                <p>Best of BETT 2018 "Classoos provides an opportunity for schools to have a single platform containing digital versions of all the textbooks students will need. If you have 1:1 devices, or are thinking of introducing them, this platform seems like a no-brainer to me, and represents the future of the textbook in schools."</p>
